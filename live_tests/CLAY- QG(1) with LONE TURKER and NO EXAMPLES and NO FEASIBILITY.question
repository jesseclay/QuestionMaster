      <h2>Passage:</h2>
        <p>That extinguishment, incidentally, may explain in part why his approach to the Compromise of 1850 was the least successful οf his forays into the compromise arena. That is to say, it was not related to one of his presidential candidacies. This may also explain why his unusually sharp sense of floor tactics failed him in the Senate in 1850. To be sure, Clay was old, tired, sick, and out of sorts by 1850. Further, the specific issues to be compromised that year were far more numerous, technical, and complex than they had been in either 1821 or 1833.</p>

        <p>Still, one must agree with Professor Holman Hamilton's assessment that while Clay's participation in the debate was useful, even inspiring, chief credit for working out the Compromise of 1850 must go to Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. Actually, it may be better for Clay’s historical reputation if we disassociate him altogether from the 1850 debacle. Not only was it the least effective of the traditional "big three" compromises usually attributed to him, it was certainly the most transitory. Thanks to that part of the deal that was the Fugitive Slave Act (which Clay vigorously supported), the Compromise of 1850 was virtually stillborn.</p>
